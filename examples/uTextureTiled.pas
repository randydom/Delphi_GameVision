  This is a game template you can use in your projects as a starting point.

  1. Add GameVision.GameTemplate unit to your project
  2. Save-as a new unit name
  3. Place cursor on TGVGameTemplate and press Shft+Ctrl+E to rename
  4. Update { TGVGameTemplate } throughout to your liking
  5. Enjoy
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In GameVision you have a these OnXXX callback methods that you can
  override to add functionaliy to your game. The minimum methods that you
  must override include:
    OnSetSettings - set game settings
    OnStartup     - run game startup code
    OnShutdown    - run game shutdown code
    OnUpdateFrame - run game update code
    OnRenderFrame - run game rendering code
    OnRenderHUD   - run game hud rendering code
